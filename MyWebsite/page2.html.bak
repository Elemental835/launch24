    <h1><b>MY HOMETOWN</b></h1>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    My hometown is Auburn MA. It is small, at only 16.2 miles squared and
    ~16,000 residents. Auburn was settled in 1778 and our high school is the
    Auburn Rockets because the first rocket that was shot was shot from
    Pakachoag Hill. Auburn also has it's own flag and seal, with the flag just
    being a house with "TOWN OF AUBURN" at the top and the seat being an eagle
    with the same thing.<br>
